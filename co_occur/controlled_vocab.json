A musician\u2019s sense of pulse is subjective, not objective; musicians interpret and perform the passage of time and the presence of the pulse in slightly different ways. As musicians perform, the push and pull of those subjective interpretations adds tension to a performance and produces a sense of\u00a0groove. Much modern audio recording and production software has a \u201chumanizing\u201d function to replicate that feeling of subjectivity, which helps subdue the otherwise robotic, or mechanical sounds of computer-generated music.\u201d (Grove Music, \u201cGroove\u201d)",
